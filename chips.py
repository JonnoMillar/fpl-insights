The four chip recommenders: Free Hit, Triple Captain, Bench Boost,
Wildcard - what week to target, and how strong the case actually is.

Each chip reads the shared windowed-EP layer (analysis.windowed_ep for the
manager's own 15, transfers.windowed_candidate_score for the wider pool
squadbuilder optimizes over) differently: Free Hit and Wildcard hand their
pool to squadbuilder, Triple Captain and Bench Boost scan the manager's
own squad directly.
